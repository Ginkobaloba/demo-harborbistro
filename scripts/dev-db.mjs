/**
 * Bring up the dev database and PROVE you are talking to it.
 *
 *   node scripts/dev-db.mjs          # up, verify, print the DATABASE_URL
 *   node scripts/dev-db.mjs --down   # stop it
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT JUST `docker compose up`. A `-p 127.0.0.1:PORT:5432` binding
 * can FAIL SILENTLY: the container comes up publishing nothing, and if some
 * other process already owns that port, every TCP connection goes THERE
 * instead. That happened while building the harborbistro suite -- the port
 * belonged to another session's Postgres, and the test was refused only
 * because the password differed. Had it matched, the suite would have dropped
 * their schemas.
 *
 * What made it hard to see: `docker exec psql` kept working the whole time,
 * because that uses the container's own socket. Only TCP went elsewhere. So
 * this script checks the thing that actually failed -- it READS THE PUBLISHED
 * PORT BACK out of docker, and then connects over TCP and asks the database to
 * identify itself.
 *
 * Three checks, in the order they can fail:
 *   1. the container published a host port at all
 *   2. TCP reaches a Postgres that accepts our credentials
 *   3. that Postgres holds only tables this project defines
 *
 * Check 3 is the one a smell test misses. See src/lib/scratch-db-guard.ts.
