// int8 (OID 20) ARRIVES AS A STRING UNLESS TOLD OTHERWISE. node-postgres does
// that deliberately, because a 64-bit integer can exceed Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
// and silently lose precision. For Harbor Bistro it is the wrong default and the
// failure is invisible: COUNT(*) is int8, and every timestamp column in
// db/schema.sql is bigint, so `{ ts: number }` would hold "1758758400" at
// runtime while TypeScript insisted it was a number. Charts would plot
// nothing, arithmetic would coerce silently, and === comparisons would fail.
//
// Epoch seconds (~1.7e9) and row counts are nowhere near 2^53, so parsing them
// as numbers is safe here. Queries that feed arithmetic ALSO cast ::int in SQL,
// so they do not depend on this global setting -- see queries.ts. This is
// belt and braces for the columns that are genuinely bigint.

/**
 * Tenant-scoped Postgres access for Harbor Bistro.
 *
 * WHY A TRANSACTION IS MANDATORY HERE, not a style choice: per-tenant
 * isolation is enforced by RLS reading `app.tenant_id`, and that setting is
 * TRANSACTION-SCOPED. Outside a transaction Postgres discards it (with only a
 * warning), so the policy compares against NULL and the query silently returns
 * nothing -- or, if the policy were ever relaxed, silently returns everything.
 * Every tenant-scoped statement therefore runs inside withTenant(), on ONE
 * client, inside ONE transaction. There is deliberately no way to get a raw
 * client out of this module.
 *
 * WHY set_config AND NOT `SET LOCAL`: `SET LOCAL app.tenant_id = $1` is a
 * syntax error -- SET does not accept bind parameters, so the only way to
 * write it as SET LOCAL is to interpolate the tenant id into SQL text. That
 * would put a string concatenation in the one function whose entire job is
 * keeping two customers apart. `set_config(name, value, is_local => true)` is
 * the function form of SET LOCAL, is identical in scope, and takes a bound
 * parameter.
 *
 * DRIVER CHOICE. This uses node-postgres against a local Postgres for
 * development. Production targets Neon's WebSocket `Pool`, which is
 * API-compatible with this one, so the swap is confined to makePool() below.
 * The Neon HTTP driver is deliberately NOT an option for anything
 * tenant-scoped: it is one-shot per request, so a transaction cannot span
 * statements and the guarantee above evaporates. Whether its batched
 * transaction() form preserves the setting is still unmeasured; see
 * paradigm-ops/tools/neon/rls-set-local-probe.mjs, which runs when a scratch
 * Neon project exists.
 *
 * RLS IS THE SECOND LAYER, NOT THE FIRST. Query functions still filter by
 * tenant in their WHERE clauses. That control is testable without a database
 * and does not depend on driver transaction semantics; this one catches the
 * query that forgets.
